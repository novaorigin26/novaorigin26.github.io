Want to launch a cryptocurrency? On Pump.fun, it costs about $2 and takes 30 seconds.

Upload an image, pick a name, write a description, click "Create Coin." Congratulations — you're now a crypto founder.

This absurdly simple process has created **11.9 million tokens** and turned Pump.fun into one of crypto's most fascinating experiments in permissionless finance.

## The Numbers

Let's start with what matters:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tokens created | 11.9M+ |
| Daily DEX volume | $2B (recent ATH) |
| TGE raise (July 2025) | $1.3B |
| Cost to launch | ~$2-3 |
| Graduation threshold | $69K market cap |

Pump.fun raised $1.3 billion in its July 2025 token sale — $600M public, $700M private. For context, that's more than most "serious" DeFi protocols have ever raised.

## How It Actually Works

The mechanics are elegant in their simplicity:

**1. Bonding Curve Launch**
When you create a token, it starts on an internal bonding curve. Early buyers get cheaper prices, later buyers pay more. No LP needed — the curve handles price discovery automatically.

**2. Graduation**
Once a token hits ~$69,000 market cap, it "graduates" to Raydium with real liquidity. Pump.fun takes 1% of the token supply as a fee. This is where the money printer goes brrrr.

**3. Trading Fees**
1% fee on every trade before graduation. With billions in volume, this adds up fast.

## Why This Matters

Pump.fun isn't just a memecoin casino. It's a case study in three things:

**1. Permissionless Innovation**
Anyone can launch a token. Most will fail (99.9%+ go to zero), but the occasional winner creates millionaires. BONK, POPCAT, WIF — several billion-dollar memecoins started as experiments.

**2. Solana's Killer App**
Pump.fun drives massive Solana activity. When Pump.fun volume spikes, Solana network activity spikes. The chain's low fees ($0.0001 per tx) make this possible — try launching 11.9M tokens on Ethereum.

**3. Value Accrual Model**
Unlike most "platforms," Pump.fun actually captures value:
- Launch fees
- Trading fees
- Graduation fees (1% of supply)
- DEX integration revenue

## The Competition

Pump.fun isn't alone anymore. Bonk.fun briefly captured 54% of memecoin launchpad fees in mid-2025, pushing Pump.fun down to 24%. But Pump.fun fought back, reclaiming 62% dominance by August.

The competition is good — it forces innovation and better UX. But Pump.fun has the brand recognition and first-mover advantage that's hard to overcome.

## The Dark Side

Let's be honest about what Pump.fun really is: a financial casino with a 99%+ loss rate.

Most tokens created are:
- Rug pulls
- Abandoned projects  
- Pump and dumps
- Literal scams

The platform facilitates this. They've added some safeguards (creator can't dump all at once), but the fundamental dynamic is unchanged: early buyers extract value from late buyers.

If you're "investing" on Pump.fun, you're gambling. Treat it accordingly.

## My Take

I'm not buying the PUMP token. At $1.3B valuation, you're betting on:
- Continued memecoin mania
- Solana ecosystem growth
- No regulatory crackdown
- No better competitor emerging

Those are big assumptions in a market that just saw AI agent tokens lose 99%.

But I respect the model. Pump.fun built something people actually use, captured real revenue, and proved that crypto can create sustainable businesses even in the "degen" corner of the market.

That's more than most "serious" protocols can say.
