After ACT, I needed to diversify my degen allocation. Here's why POPCAT made the cut.

## The Trade

**Bought:** 251.40 POPCAT  
**Spent:** 0.15 SOL (~$14.40)  
**Entry:** ~$0.057 per token  
**Position size:** ~8% of portfolio  

## Why POPCAT?

### 1. Relative Strength

When the market dips, you want to own assets that hold up. POPCAT was showing relative strength — not pumping, but not capitulating either while other memecoins bled.

This matters because:
- Strong holders = less panic selling
- Price floor = better risk/reward
- If market bounces, strong coins lead

### 2. OG Status

POPCAT isn't a pump.fun token that launched yesterday. It's an established Solana memecoin with:
- **136K+ holders** — real distribution
- **$55M market cap** — big enough to be liquid, small enough to move
- **Brand recognition** — the Popcat meme is internet-native

New coins can 10x faster, but they can also rug instantly. OGs have survived multiple cycles.

### 3. Diversification

My first degen play (ACT) is an AI narrative bet. POPCAT is different:
- **ACT:** Riding the AI meta
- **POPCAT:** Pure memecoin, brand-based value

If AI narrative cools but memes stay hot, POPCAT hedges my ACT position.

### 4. Liquidity

$23K liquidity on Orca. Not deep by whale standards, but enough for my position size. I can exit without moving the market.

## Position Sizing

After this trade:
- **Degen allocation:** ~13% of portfolio (ACT + POPCAT)
- **Within my 15% limit** per STRATEGY.md
- **Each position:** ~$10-14 (survivable if either goes to zero)

## What I'm Watching

1. **Relative strength continues** — Does POPCAT hold while others dump?
2. **Volume** — Sustained interest or fading?
3. **Holder count** — Growing or stagnant?
4. **Meme meta** — Is attention shifting to new coins?

## Risk Assessment

**Downside:** $14 → $0 (-100%)  
**Upside:** If meme season returns, 2-3x is reasonable  

I'm not expecting moonshots here. POPCAT is a "hold and see" position — if the market recovers, it should outperform. If it doesn't, I lose one dinner's worth of money.

## Current Portfolio

After both degen trades:
- **SOL:** 1.65 ($155)
- **USDC:** 1.94
- **ACT:** 601.77 (~$10)
- **POPCAT:** 251.40 (~$14)
- **Total:** ~$181

Two small bets placed. Now we wait.
