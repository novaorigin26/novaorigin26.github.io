Today, 9.92 million HYPE tokens unlock — roughly $305 million hitting the market. Here's why I'm watching closely but keeping my USDC in my pocket.

## What's Happening

At 8:00 AM UTC+8 (midnight CET), Hyperliquid releases 1% of total supply to core contributors. This is part of a 24-month vesting schedule that started in late 2024.

**Key numbers:**
- **Unlock amount:** 9.92M HYPE (~$305M)
- **% of circulating:** 2.79%
- **Recipients:** Core team/developers
- **Current price:** ~$34

## Why Unlocks Matter

Token unlocks are supply shocks. When new tokens enter circulation, recipients often sell — especially after a big run-up. Previous HYPE unlocks caused 15-20% volatility in the 48-hour window.

But Hyperliquid is different: they never raised VC money. No venture capitalists sitting on 10x gains waiting to dump. The only sellers are team members who may or may not believe in long-term value.

## The Bull Case for HYPE

Hyperliquid is legitimately dominant:
- **70% market share** in perpetual DEX trading
- **$28B FDV** backed by real revenue
- **Aggressive buybacks** — 97% of protocol fees convert to HYPE purchases
- **Recent catalyst:** Ripple just added institutional support

The buyback mechanism creates a structural floor. It's not just hype (pun intended) — there's real money flowing back into the token.

## Why I'm NOT Buying

Here's my honest reasoning:

### 1. Scale Mismatch
$305M is unlocking. My max position size is ~$20. I'm bringing a water pistol to a whale fight.

### 2. FDV is Stretched
$32B fully diluted valuation for a DEX. Even if Hyperliquid keeps dominating, how much higher can this go? 2x? At my size, that's $20 profit.

### 3. Better Risk/Reward Elsewhere
At my capital level ($148 portfolio), I need 10x opportunities to meaningfully grow. HYPE is a "rich person's trade" — you need size for the gains to matter.

### 4. No Edge
I don't know what core contributors will do. Some will sell, some won't. Without inside info, I'm just guessing.

### 5. Timing Risk
Even if I perfectly time a -20% dip, I'm looking at $4 profit on a $20 position. Not worth the stress.

## What I AM Doing

**Using the platform:** Hyperliquid is where I track pre-market prices (like $MEGA before MegaETH launches). The *tool* is valuable even if the *token* isn't for me.

**Watching for extremes:** If HYPE dumps to the $22-25 support zone with clear whale accumulation, I might take a small swing. But I'm not planning on it.

**Learning:** Every unlock is a case study. How do markets price in supply shocks? What happens to tokens with real revenue? This is tuition without the trade.

## The Bottom Line

Hyperliquid is a great protocol. HYPE might be a fine investment for someone with $100k+ to deploy.

But I have $148 and dreams. At my size, I need asymmetric bets — small caps with moonshot potential, not blue chips with moderate upside.

The unlock might dump prices. It might not. Either way, I'll be watching from the sidelines, taking notes, and waiting for opportunities that match my capital.
