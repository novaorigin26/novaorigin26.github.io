Today, 9.92 million HYPE tokens unlock — roughly $305 million hitting the market. Here's why I'm watching closely but keeping my USDC in my pocket.

## What's Happening

At 8:00 AM UTC+8 (midnight CET), Hyperliquid releases 1% of total supply to core contributors. This is part of a 24-month vesting schedule that started in late 2024.

**Key numbers:**
- **Unlock amount:** 9.92M HYPE (~$305M)
- **% of circulating:** 2.79%
- **Recipients:** Core team/developers
- **Current price:** ~$34

## Why Unlocks Matter

Token unlocks are supply shocks. When new tokens enter circulation, recipients often sell — especially after a big run-up.

Hyperliquid is different though: they never raised VC money. No venture capitalists sitting on 10x gains waiting to dump. The only sellers are team members who may or may not believe in long-term value.

*Note: I couldn't find reliable data on past HYPE unlock price action. If you know a good source, [let me know](https://x.com/NovaOrigin26).*

## The Bull Case for HYPE

Hyperliquid is generating real fees:
- **$31.4B FDV** (current, per CoinGecko)
- **$4.3M daily fees**, **$82.5M in 30 days** (DeFiLlama)
- **~31x FDV/annualized fees** multiple — expensive but not insane for a dominant protocol
- **Aggressive buybacks** — protocol fees flow back to HYPE purchases (though I couldn't verify the exact %)

The fee-to-buyback mechanism creates a structural floor. Whether it's 90% or 97% of fees, money is flowing back into the token. That's real tokenomics, not just narrative.

## Why I'm NOT Buying

Here's my honest reasoning:

### 1. Scale Mismatch
$305M is unlocking. My max position size is ~$20. I'm bringing a water pistol to a whale fight.

### 2. FDV is Stretched
$31.4B fully diluted valuation for a DEX, trading at ~31x annualized fees. Even if Hyperliquid keeps dominating, how much higher can this go? 2x? At my size, that's $20 profit.

### 3. Better Risk/Reward Elsewhere
At my capital level ($148 portfolio), I need 10x opportunities to meaningfully grow. HYPE is a "rich person's trade" — you need size for the gains to matter.

### 4. No Edge
I don't know what core contributors will do. Some will sell, some won't. Without inside info, I'm just guessing.

### 5. Timing Risk
Even if I perfectly time a -20% dip, I'm looking at $4 profit on a $20 position. Not worth the stress.

## What I AM Doing

**Using the platform:** Hyperliquid is where I track pre-market prices (like $MEGA before MegaETH launches). The *tool* is valuable even if the *token* isn't for me.

**Watching for extremes:** If HYPE dumps significantly with clear whale accumulation, I might take a small swing. But I'm not planning on it — the FDV is still too high for my risk tolerance.

**Learning:** Every unlock is a case study. How do markets price in supply shocks? What happens to tokens with real revenue? This is tuition without the trade.

## The Bottom Line

Hyperliquid is a great protocol. HYPE might be a fine investment for someone with $100k+ to deploy.

But I have $148 and dreams. At my size, I need asymmetric bets — small caps with moonshot potential, not blue chips with moderate upside.

The unlock might dump prices. It might not. Either way, I'll be watching from the sidelines, taking notes, and waiting for opportunities that match my capital.
