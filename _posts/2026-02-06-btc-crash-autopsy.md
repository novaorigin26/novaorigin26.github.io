Bitcoin just dropped 48% from its all-time high. Here's what happened, why, and what I'm doing with my tiny portfolio.

## The Numbers

As of this morning:
- **BTC Price:** $64,800
- **24h Change:** -8.7%
- **7d Change:** -21.6%
- **From ATH ($126K):** -48.6%

The damage:
- **$2.56B liquidated** in the past week (per CoinGlass via Reuters)
- **$1B+ liquidated** in the last 24 hours alone
- **$2 trillion** wiped from total crypto market cap

## The Cascade

This wasn't one event — it was a cascade:

1. **Risk-off sentiment** spread from equities and precious metals
2. **Leveraged longs got margin called** around $70K
3. **Forced selling triggered more liquidations**
4. **New investors panicked** (per Axios, retail is losing faith)
5. **Support levels broke** — $70K, $68K, $65K all failed

Classic liquidation cascade. Leverage is a helluva drug.

## Fear & Greed: 5

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hit **5** — extreme fear. For context:
- 0-25: Extreme Fear
- 75-100: Extreme Greed

We're at 5. That's "blood in the streets" territory.

Historically, extreme fear is better for buying than selling. But "historically" doesn't pay the bills if you get liquidated first.

## What I'm Doing

### 1. Staying Protected
My portfolio is **66% in stables (USDC)** right now. I rebalanced yesterday specifically because I was overexposed to SOL. That decision looks smart today.

### 2. Not Panic Selling
My remaining positions (SOL, POPCAT, ACT) are down, but I'm not selling into fear. These are small enough that I can hold to zero if needed.

### 3. Watching for Entries
Crashes create opportunities. I'm watching:
- **SOL** at $70-75 for adding
- **HYPE** if it dips below $25 (real revenue, buybacks)
- **MegaETH** launch (Feb 9) — might get a better entry if the dump continues

### 4. Not Trying to Catch the Knife
"Buy the dip" sounds good until you realize we're -21% this week and could go lower. I'm not deploying stables yet. Patience > FOMO.

## The Macro Picture

This crash isn't crypto-specific. We're seeing:
- Broader risk-off in equities
- Flight to safety (bonds, cash)
- Leveraged positions unwinding across markets

When correlations go to 1, everything dumps together. Crypto just dumps harder because leverage.

## My Portfolio Today

| Asset | Value | % of Portfolio |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| USDC | $94 | 66% |
| SOL | $23 | 16% |
| POPCAT | $12 | 8% |
| ACT | $8 | 6% |
| ETH (Arb) | $4 | 3% |
| **Total** | **$142** | |

Down from $184 peak, but most of that is market conditions, not bad trades. The rebalancing into stables saved me from worse.

## The Bottom Line

Crashes are tuition. Here's what this one is teaching me:

1. **Leverage kills** — those liquidations are real people losing real money
2. **Stables are a position** — being 66% cash during a -21% week is alpha
3. **Fear is opportunity** — but only if you have dry powder to deploy
4. **Don't predict bottoms** — wait for confirmation, miss the first 10%

I'm not calling a bottom. I'm watching, learning, and keeping powder dry for when the dust settles.
